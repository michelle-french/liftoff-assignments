## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This app is a health and wellness tracker. It provides a convenience to the logged-in user by 
offering the ability to keep track of appointments, medications, pain, food intake, exercise and/or mood. 
It is especially useful for any type of caretaker (parent, babysitter, pet owner, personal assistants, etc.)
due to the capability of creating multiple profiles for a single user. It will eliminate the need for having
numerous apps such as one for appointments, another for logging exercise frequency and yet another for 
tracking moods. 
The idea came from the need to keep track of a family member's pain levels, times, and frequency along with
the need to ensure multiple medications were being taken on time and in correct dosages while also needing 
to track my own wellness (mood levels & exercise frequency). In order to eliminate the need for a notebook 
to log and track important medical information and gain the ability to conveniently access the information 
from any computer or phone, I chose to solve the issue with a multi-faceted health tracker app.
### Features
    -User can log-in to home page which will have a link to each of their profiles
	-Each profile will open to links for each tracker
	-Each tracker page will have drop-down menus along with text boxes to record information. User can add,
        update and access information
	-From appointment page, user can access Google maps for directions 
### Technologies
    -Java
	-Spring Boot
	-MySQL
### What I'll Have to Learn
In order for user to access Google Maps for directions to each appointment, I will need to learn 
how to use an API.
